ShippingQuote breaks computes how many packages are needed to ship the contents of a user's shopping cart based on Item
Weight, Ship Code, and a set Max Box Weight. ShipQuote then will push send these packages to UPS, FedEx, USPS, and R&L
Freight to give a final shipping quote for the entire cart. Quotes are returned as the discounted negotiated rate
(linked to the username, password).

* Creates Packages from Cart_Items
* Sends to ActiveShipping & R&L Carriers for Quotes
* Filters returned quotes


## Installation

Update values in shipping-quote.yml and place in your RAILS_ENV/config folder.
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'shipping-quote', :github => 'rdaniels/shipping-quote'

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Usage
    require 'shipping-quote'

    ship = ShippingQuote::Shipping.new(@cart_items)
    shown_rates = ship.runner(destination)
    boxing_charge = ship.boxing_charge


runner also takes an optional ship_selected argument, this will only return that ship method

cart_items is an array of items

example item

    {   ref01: '3000',
        name: 'Super Widget'
        shipCode: 'UPS',
        isGlass: nil,
        qty: 1,
        weight: 0.4,
        backorder: 0,
        vendor: 10,
        ormd: nil,
        glassConverter: nil,
        freeShipping: nil }

example destination

    {   :country => 'US',
        :street => '1234 fake street',
        :street2 => nil,
        :province => 'FL',
        :city => 'Tampa',
        :postal_code => '33609'
        :price_class => 1 }

available shipCodes include: UPS, SHA, LEA, TRK, MDA, NPA

freeShipping: 1 = eligable if min reached, 2 = always free, 3 = daily deal

shipping-quote-spec.rb before adding code to shipping-quote.rb.
