module ShippingCalc

  # This API is based on version 03 of the Freight Quote's (FQ) connection test,
  # release on 2007 (and still used on 2008). When you first create the
  # account you'll receive a test account that works with your username and
  # password.
  #
  # After having a stable system you should e-mail FQ asking for a
  # production key to the servers. If you want to test with a generic
  # username and password you can the user "xmltest@FreightQuote.com" with password "XML",
  # but this won't give you access to all the debugging info. associated with
  # your account (or so they say).
  class FreightQuote

    # Obtains some shipping quotes using freight carriers from FQ's site.
    # The return value is a hash like {carrier_name => rate} so you can see
    # all the available prices.
    # <tt>params</tt> is a hash with all the settings for the shipment. They
    # are:
    #
    # :*api_email*:: API access email, provided by FQ.
    # :*api_password*:: API access password, provided by FQ.
    # :*from_zip*:: Sender's zip code.
    # :*to_zip*:: Recipient's zip code.
    # :*weight*:: Total weight of the order in lbs.
    # :*dimensions*:: _Optional_ - Length, width and height of the shipment, described as a string: "[Length]x[Width]x[Height]" (e.g. "23x32x15").
    # :*description*:: _Optional_ - Description of the stuff that's being shipped. Defaults to "NODESC".
    # :*class*:: _Optional_ - Freightquote's shipping class. Defaults to nil.
    # :*from_conditions*:: _Optional_ - String that indicates if the sending location is a residence ("RES"), a business with a forklift or dock ("BIZ_WITH") or a business without a forklift or dock ("BIZ_WITHOUT"). Defaults to "RES".
    # :*to_conditions*:: _Optional_ - String that indicates if the receiving location is a residence ("RES"), a business with a forklift or dock ("BIZ_WITH") or a business without a forklift or dock ("BIZ_WITHOUT"). Defaults to "RES".
    # :*liftgate*:: _Optional_ - A boolean indicating if a liftgate's required at the receiving location (API page 10). Defaults to false.
    # :*inside_delivery*:: _Optional_ - A boolean indicating if inside delivery's required at the receiving location (API page 10). Defaults to false.
    # *Note* Both dimensions or class are optional but one of them has to be there. If both parameters are filled then priority will be given to class.
